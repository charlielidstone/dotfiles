# dotfiles
These configs are still a work in progress. Also, I'm currently switching from Ubuntu + Gnome to Arch, so the Gnome themes probably won't change any further.

## Installation
After cloning into the root directory, create a symbolic link with the `ln` command for the desired directories:

### Gnome Themes

`ln -s ~/dotfiles/gnome/.themes ~/.themes`

### Neovim

`ln -s ~/dotfiles/nvim /path/to/configs/nvim` 

> **Note:** The correct location for the nvim config directory will vary.
